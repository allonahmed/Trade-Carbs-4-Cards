-FIX UP HOMEPAGE A BIT (CAN SAVE FOR LATER HONESTLY) (1HR)




-BUG got to fix the radio button that stores what workouts they can do. right now they can only do a single workout.
maybe make the selectExersice an array and everytime, you check the radio, push to array, and if you uncheck, remove 

--make the user info a dropdown menu

finish dropdown menu, change style instead of class
